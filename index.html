    <p>Welcome to rocking scratchers</p>

    <div id="aboutus">
        <p><strong>Rocking Scratchers</strong> is a scratch party created by @Smartisha15 in 2020.
        Rocking scratchers focuses on making <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" title="scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> a better
        place for everyone. We'll make sure that no one regulates the scratch community guidlines
         and make sure that all projects are appropriate. Rocking Scratchers is managed by @Smartisha15 and @Keanechaw</p>
